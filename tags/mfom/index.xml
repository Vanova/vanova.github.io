      <description>This work tackles the problem of the domestic audio tagging or environmental sound classification, where one audio recording can contain one or more acoustic events and a recognizer should output all of those tags. A baseline model for this task is a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) with sigmoid output nodes optimized using the binary crossentropy objective. Traditional error metrics, such as classification error, are not suitable for this type of task.</description>

      <title>Deep learning with Maximal Figure-of-Merit Cost to Advance Multi-label Speech Attribute Detection</title>

      <description>In this work, we are interested in boosting speech attribute detection by formulating it as a multi-label classification task, and deep neural networks (DNNs) are used to design speech attribute detectors. A straightforward way to tackle the speech attribute detection task is to estimate DNN parameters using the mean squared error (MSE) loss function and employ a sigmoid function in the DNN output nodes. A more principled way is nonetheless to incorporate the micro-F1 measure, which is a widely used metric in the multi-label classification, into the DNN loss function to directly improve the metric of interest at training time.</description>
