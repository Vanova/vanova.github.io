      <title>The I2R’s Submission To VOiCES Distance Speaker Recognition Challenge 2019</title>

      <description>This paper is about the I2R’s submission to the VOiCES from a distance speaker recognition challenge 2019. The submissions were based on the fusion of two x-vectors and two i-vectors subsystems. Main efforts have been focused on the frontend de-reverberation processing, PLDA backend design, score normalization and fusion studies in order to improve the system performance on single channel distant/farfield audio, under noisy conditions. We contribute to the fixed condition task under specific training and development data set.</description>

      <description>The I4U consortium was established to facilitate a joint entry to NIST speaker recognition evaluations (SRE). The latest edition of such joint submission was in SRE 2018, in which the I4U submission was among the best-performing systems. SRE&amp;rsquo;18 also marks the 10-year anniversary of I4U consortium into NIST SRE series of evaluation. The primary objective of the current paper is to summarize the results and lessons learned based on the twelve sub-systems and their fusion submitted to SRE&amp;rsquo;18.</description>

      <title>Maximal Figure-of-Merit Embedding for Multi-label Audio Classification</title>

      <description>This work tackles the problem of the domestic audio tagging or environmental sound classification, where one audio recording can contain one or more acoustic events and a recognizer should output all of those tags. A baseline model for this task is a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) with sigmoid output nodes optimized using the binary crossentropy objective. Traditional error metrics, such as classification error, are not suitable for this type of task.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Neural Network and Maximal Figure of Merit for Acoustic Event Detection</title>

      <description>In this report, we describe the systems submitted to the DCASE 2017 challenge. In particular, we explored convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) for acoustic scene classification (Task 1). For the weakly supervised sound event detection (Task 4), we utilized CRNN by embedding maximal figure-of-merit (CRNNMFoM) into the binary cross-entropy objective function. On the development data set, the CRNN model achieves an average 14.7% relative accuracy improvement on the classification Task 1, the CRNN-MFoM improves F1-score from 10.</description>

      <title>Deep learning with Maximal Figure-of-Merit Cost to Advance Multi-label Speech Attribute Detection</title>
      <link>https://vanova.github.io/publication/2016/pub6/</link>

      <description>In this work, we are interested in boosting speech attribute detection by formulating it as a multi-label classification task, and deep neural networks (DNNs) are used to design speech attribute detectors. A straightforward way to tackle the speech attribute detection task is to estimate DNN parameters using the mean squared error (MSE) loss function and employ a sigmoid function in the DNN output nodes. A more principled way is nonetheless to incorporate the micro-F1 measure, which is a widely used metric in the multi-label classification, into the DNN loss function to directly improve the metric of interest at training time.</description>
